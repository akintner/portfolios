# Dr. Amy Kintner - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

I will admit I entered Mod 4 warily. After hearing the tales of the last 3 graduating cohorts, I approached the final mod with something rather akin to dread. I set out, therefore, to learn as much as I could from whatever the module would hold, which ended up being quite a bit about Javascript, a bit about React, and more advanced, production-ready facts about Rails. The four weeks I did complete of Mod 4 were interesting, I learned a great deal, and I discovered that my trepidation was only partially merited. The mod was far from easy, with the first week for me being a complete and utter nightmare of work and conflicting obligations. What kept my time from being entirely soul-crushing, however, was the fact that the instructors, and Casey in particular, helped me negotiate the various demands of the job hunt,  technical interviews, and school work.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### OSS Contributions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/faker)

For my OSS contributions, I spent the weekend of April 8-9 volunteering at a Go Code Colorado event in Colorado Springs. While I wasn’t working directly with a competing team - which would have had to be arranged in advance, but is perhaps an interesting idea for Turing students going forward - I floated around and helped wherever needed. I ended up helping a team that was using the NREL API, as I’d used that for some work in Mod 3 and was at least semi-familiar with what the API had to offer.

For my main contribution, I added Faker::StarTrek to the faker gem library. It was both fun and interesting joining in with the OS community, and I had some communication with the gem’s creator, Benjamin, on my PR after I’d mistakenly made all my methods plural (and they’re supposed to be singular as only one object is returned when the methods are called, though that’s not outlined in the docs anywhere). I think that PR got merged in a few days back, so I’ve officially made a Faker library. Live long and prosper. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two group project this Mod: the first week was Quantified Self, a wholly Javascript project without a backend at all (eek), and the Capstone project, Johari Window.

#### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/quantified_self)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self.md)

This project was a food-tracking front-end built with Javascript and JQuery. 


#### Eval: 
- ** Specification Adherence = 3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect**

- **Testing = 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type**

- ** HTML/UI = 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.**

- ** JS syntax and Style = 3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.**

- ** Git Workflow = 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation**

- ** Project Management = 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.**

#### Capstone Project: Johari Window

* [GitHub URL Front-End](https://github.com/lucyconklin/johari-window)
* [Github URL Back-End](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/johari_window_api)

This project aimed to made an online portal for the Professional Development Johari Window exercise that we all did in Mod 2. More info about the Joarhi Window's history and usage is linked in the README for the project linked above. 

## D: Professional Skills

The main goal for everyone is, I believe, to get us all jobs! The most valuable lesson for me was certainly the salary negotiation PD session, but I also loved the live technical interview that was done with the generous help of Ian Douglas and Emily Freeman. 

### Gear Up
#### Mod 4 Leads Automation Gear-Up Planning Sessions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Our group decided to give our set of students some readings to do the night before, which we would then discuss openly for most of the time allotted. We also viewed the two movies from the original session (can be seen in MD file).
Our outline is here: (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/pull/22/commits/e774fdb2486098435244e8e707e27610bbcc32e5)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation


### Playing a Part

I independently reviewed the cover letters of a number of students at Turing this mod, including Drew from our Mod.
