# Dr. Amy Kintner - M4 Portfolio

## Areas of Emphasis

The end of April and of my time at Turing marks an exit from what I've been lovingly referring to as "26th grade." I will admit I entered Mod 4 warily, part of which was due to exhaustion and burn-out and part of which was due to the woeful, stress-filled tales of the last three graduating cohorts. For these reasons, I approached the final mod with something rather akin to dread. To help overcome this, I set out to learn as much as I could from whatever the module would hold, which ended up being quite a bit about Javascript, a week of work in Node, a moderate amount about React, and more advanced, production-level facts and tidbits about Rails. The four weeks I did complete of Mod 4 were interesting, I learned a great deal, and I discovered that my trepidation was only partially merited. The mod was far from easy, with the first week for me being a complete and utter nightmare of work and conflicting obligations. What kept me from dropping out of the 26th grade, however, was the fact that the instructors - and Casey in particular - helped me negotiate the various demands of the job hunt, technical interviews, and school work. This mod never could have happened without the help and support of the Turing staff, and it is to them that I owe part of my success and most of my sanity. 
<br>
One final note: as I was only at Turing for three and a half weeks of this mod, many of the sections below contain partial information. To compensate for this - and because I'm an academic who loves words, writing, and everything literary - I've added an extra section to the end of my portfolio that attempts to offer commentary about the move from Turing into the wild west of actual software development.

## B: Individual Work & Projects

#### OSS Contributions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/akintner/faker)

For my OSS contributions, I spent the weekend of April 8-9 volunteering at a Go Code Colorado event in Colorado Springs. While I wasn’t working directly with a competing team - which would have had to be arranged in advance, but is perhaps an interesting idea for Turing students going forward - I floated around and helped wherever needed. I ended up helping a team that was using the NREL API, as I’d used that for some work in Mod 3 and was at least semi-familiar with what the API had to offer.  
<br>
For my main contribution, I added Faker::StarTrek to the faker gem library. It was both fun and interesting joining in with the OS community, and I had some communication with the gem’s creator, Benjamin, on my PR after I’d mistakenly made all my methods plural (and they’re supposed to be singular as only one object is returned when the methods are called, though that’s not outlined in the docs anywhere). I think that PR got merged in a few days back, so I’ve officially made a Faker library. Live long and prosper. 


## C: Group Work & Projects

### Projects

We had two group project this Mod: the first week was Quantified Self, a Javascript project without a backend at all (eek), and the Capstone project, Johari Window, which was a React app that worked in tandem with a Rails API.

#### Quantified Self

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/quantified_self)
* [Original Assignment](https://github.com/turingschool/backend-curriculum-site/blob/gh-pages/module4/projects/quantified-self/quantified-self.md)

This project was a food-tracking front-end built with Javascript and JQuery. 


#### Eval: 
- Specification Adherence = 3: Application implements all functionality as defined, but some bugs or strange behavior where features intersect

- Testing = 2: More functionality implemented than tested or only uses one test type

- HTML/UI = 3: Application is not confusing to use. HTML classes and IDs are kebab case.

- JS syntax and Style = 3: Code logically divided into files. Developer can show examples of some SOLID concepts. Attention payed to indentation and naming.

- Git Workflow = 4: Team uses master for production, and creates a feature branch for each card worked on. Team is using pull requests with good context and conversation

- Project Management = 4: Team is using a project management tool and updating their progress daily. Team is approving each other's  work. Team is documenting conversations and conclusions on relevant cards.

#### Capstone Project: Johari Window

* [GitHub URL Front-End](https://github.com/lucyconklin/johari-window)
* [Github URL Back-End](https://github.com/Dpalazzari/johari_window_api)

This project aimed to made an online portal for the Professional Development Johari Window exercise that we all did in Mod 2. More info about the Joarhi Window's history and usage is linked in the README for the project linked above. 

## D: Professional Skills

The main goal for everyone is, I believe, to get us all jobs! The most valuable lesson for me was certainly the salary negotiation PD session, but I also loved the live technical interview that was done with the generous help of Ian Douglas and Emily Freeman. 

### Gear Up
#### Mod 4 Leads Automation Gear-Up Planning Sessions

* [GitHub URL](https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/blob/master/automation.markdown)

Our group decided to give our set of students some readings to do the night before, which we would then discuss openly for most of the time allotted. We also viewed the two movies from the original session (can be seen in MD file).
Our outline is here: (https://github.com/turingschool/gear-up/pull/22/commits/e774fdb2486098435244e8e707e27610bbcc32e5)

## E: Feedback and Community Participation


### Playing a Part

This mod was a whirlwind of activity that. From my vantage point now, the work from weeks one and two seem like a distant part of my past that could have taken place a year ago. But that's untrue, and my help to the Turing community began that first week when Drew and I spent almost all of every day in the pairing alley. Our companions for much of that time were Max and Edeline (of Mod 3), who were working on their Rails-engine project, with which Drew and I helped on a number of occasions. I also paired with a selection of Mod 1 BE students during the second week while they were doing their first group project. Mostly I assisted with Git issues, all the while fondly remembering how much of a terrible, confusing haze GitHub was to me back then. 
<br>
Additionally, I spent some time this Mod talking with Jeff one-on-one about the problems with morale in mod4; during this sessions, Jeff and I discussed the idea of making all work take place in week-long sprints, including the capstone project. After our discussion, Jeff and the other mod 4 instructors turned this into a reality. Numerous students over the next two weeks mentioned how wonderful this was - not everyone, but most of us - and I'm glad to have taken part in that decision, as I also think it helped ease the strain of Turing work and job-hunting tremendously. 
<br>
I also, after discussion with Anna Dolan, Emily Freeman, and Sal Espinosa, decided to make use of my total lack of fear regarding public speaking and give a lightening talk for the whole school. It ended up being far more impromptu than I'd intended, as I signed up for one in the third week, but ended up giving mine in the second after another Mod 4 colleague admitted that she had too much to do and was panicking. I stepped into her spot for the talk and gave mine instead. 
<br>
I also, at Drew's insistence, helped a few of our cohort members with their cover letters. I'm not sure why I’ve had the job-hunt success that I have, but I was glad to help with a few pointers on style and content in various cover letters, and I would be willing to continue that role at Turing, if needed.
